#### What is Computer Vision?
- A vision is the perception of 3 Dimensional entity which is captured or processed in 2 Dimensional space.
- Computer vision refers to the field of study and technology that enable computers to understand, interpret, and extract meaningful information from digital images or videos.

#### Components of Computer Vision
- **Optics**
- **Digitial Image Processing**
- **Artificial Intelligence**

#### Imaging System
- A camera, or imaging, is a device that allows the projection of light from three-dimensional points onto mediums like film or sensors that will record the light pattern.
- A projection from 3D to 2D results in loss of some information.

#### Perspective Imaging
- Mathematical method in computer vision in which 3D object or scene is projected on to 2D image plate, try to mimic human eyes.

#### Image as a Function
An image can be represented as a function (f) that takes in a pixel coordinate (x,y) and gives the intensity at that pixel.

#### Image Gradient
- It is a directional change in image intensity
- Helps to understand contours(curves) and outlines(straight lines).

#### HSV Color Model
- HSV stands for Hue, Saturation and Value
- Hue is the tone of the color
- Saturation is the intensity of the color
- Value represents the brightness concerning the saturation of the color.
