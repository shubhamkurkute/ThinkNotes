DL includes:
- **Image Recognition:** Trains machine to accurately identify and classify objects within images
- **Natural Language:** Understanding: Teaches the computers to comprehend and process human language
- **Speech Recognition:** Enables computers to transcribe and understand spoken words.

## Deep Learning
- Deep learning is subset of ML, focusing on the use of deep neural networks to process and learn complex patterns from the data.
- DL can effectively utilize the structured and unstructured data from diverse domains, encompassing of images, text, audio to discover patterns and make accurate predictions or classifications.
- DL surpasses traditional ML by leveraging the deep neural networks to extract patterns from unstructured data, resulting in superior performance in domains like computer vision, Natual Language Processing and Speech Recognition.
- This technique enables Deep Learning models to extract complex features and achieve highly accurate predictions or classifications.
