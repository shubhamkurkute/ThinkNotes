An artificial neuron is analogous to biological neurons, where each neuron takes the inputs, add weights to them separately, sums them up and passes this sum through a transfer function to produce a nonlinear output.

- Generally bias is taken as 1 at the start later it is updated.
- Threshold unit is also known as activation function which decides how much information or the part information to be transfered.

### Neural Networks and Types of Neural Networks
Neural networks consist of interconnected computation modules that stimulate the behaviour of biological neurons.
This network consist of three layers and these are all interconnected neurons:
1. Input Layer
2. Hidden Layer
3. Output Layer
