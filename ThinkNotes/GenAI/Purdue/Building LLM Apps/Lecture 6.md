## Fine Tuning
- When you want LLM to perform a task which domain specific task i.e. the trained parameters are private or only confined to a particular domain. As the LLM are trained on public data and all the public domain data
- LLM fine-tuning involves refining a language model foor specific tasks using curated datasets.

### Data Preparation for LLM Tuning
- Data preparation is vital for fine-tuning LLMs to ensure the model excels in specific tasks.
- The LLM fine-tuning process has two phases:
	- Data Preparation
	- Fine-Tuning
- The key considerations and best practices for data preparation in LLM fine-tuning:
	- **Selecting relevant data**
	- **Labelling and formatting:** Structured and consistent format like question and answer
	- **Data Augmentation:** Expanding the data by keeping the meaning same.
	- **Tagging and descriptions:** Extra meta data
	- **Tools and techniques:** Automation tools to enhance the data.
- Offline tuning: Trained before the usage of the LLM 
- Online tuning: Continous adaption make possible to model learn after deployment onto the production.
