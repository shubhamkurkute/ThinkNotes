At its core, Agentic AI is a type of AI that’s all about autonomy. This means that it can make decisions, take actions, and even learn on its own to achieve specific goals. It’s kind of like having a virtual assistant that can think, reason, and adapt to changing circumstances without needing constant direction. **Agentic AI operates in four key stages:**

1. **Perception**: It gathers data from the world around it.
2. **Reasoning**: It processes this data to understand what’s going on.
3. **Action**: It decides what to do based on its understanding.
4. **Learning**: It improves and adapts over time, learning from feedback and experience.
