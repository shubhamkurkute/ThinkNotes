On the other hand, AI Agents are typically built to do specific tasks. They’re designed to help you with something — like answering questions, organizing your calendar, or even managing your email inbox. AI Agents are great at automating simple, repetitive tasks but don’t have the autonomy or decision-making abilities that Agentic AI does. Think of them as virtual helpers that do exactly what you tell them to do, without thinking for themselves.
